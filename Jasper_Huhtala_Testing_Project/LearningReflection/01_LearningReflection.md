## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- My experience testing the given Webapp was overall positive. It provided a practical opportunity to apply testing concepts learned theoretically.  


## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I wrote down what I needed to test in a list, and then I made another list for each thing I was going to test.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -


## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- I used Visual Studio Code for writing down my tests and making changes to files.


     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
- I think the style how to write my tests consistently. I tried to made a pattern for my tests, so they all looked similar, and I think that helped a lot.


## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- If I ever want to make my tests run automatically, I'd probably use Selenium with Python. Python is easy to learn and I am currently studying in a Python course.



## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- For software testing jobs, they usually want people who are good at making and running tests, know a bit about coding, and can work well with others.



## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- To work in software testing, you should get better at things like writing tests, learning some coding basics, and being good at solving problems. You should also be good at working with others and managing your time well.




## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-The project definitely helped in applying theoretical knowledge into practice. By creating and executing test cases, I gained some understanding how testing works. I feel that incorporating more interactive exercises could enhance the learning experience further.
